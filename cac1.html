                        <h2 class="card-title">Once Upon a Time I Lived on Mars</h2>
                        <p class="card-text">In 2013, Kate Greene moved to Mars. That is, along with five fellow crew
                            members, she embarked on NASA’s first HI-SEAS mission, a simulated Martian environment
                            located on the slopes of Mauna Loa in Hawai'i. For four months she lived, worked, and slept
                            in an isolated geodesic dome, conducting a sleep study on her crew mates and gaining
                            incredible insight into human behavior in tight quarters, as well as the nature of boredom,
                            dreams, and isolation that arise amidst the promise of scientific progress and glory.

                            In Once Upon a Time I Lived on Mars, Greene draws on her experience to contemplate
                            humanity’s broader impulse to explore. The result is a twined story of space and life, of
                            the standard, able-bodied astronaut and Greene’s brother’s disability, of the lag time of
                            interplanetary correspondences and the challenges of a long-distance marriage, of
                            freeze-dried egg powder and fresh pineapple, of departure and return.

                            By asking what kind of wisdom humanity might take to Mars and elsewhere in the Universe,
                            Greene has written a remarkable, wide-ranging examination of our time in space right now, as
                            a pre-Mars species, poised on the edge, readying for launch.</p>

                        <h3>With high ethical stakes and a suspenseful past-and-present narrative, The Academy is David
                            Poyer's capstone novel in the Dan Lenson series.
                        </h3>
                        <p>In his final tour of duty after a remarkable career at sea, Dan Lenson is appointed
                            Superintendent of the US Naval Academy at Annapolis. He begins at a difficult time: Congress
                            is cutting military budgets in the wake of the devastating world war with China, calls for
                            radical reform are upending traditions, and Dan himself faces legal jeopardy for his actions
                            during the war. And when a Category 5 hurricane threatens to overwhelm the coast, Dan must
                            fight to rescue the Academy itself.

                            Parallel to this narrative runs the dramatic story of Dan's years as a first class
                            midshipman, 40 years ago. An Academy classmate commits suicide, and Dan is drawn into the
                            investigation. The decisions he makes will affect his entire career and shape how he comes
                            to lead troops in battle and at peace.</p>

                        <h3>From the acclaimed author of Malice and Newcomer, a confounding murder in Tokyo is connected
                            to the mystery of the disappearance and death of Detective Kaga's own mother.</h3>
                        <p>A decade ago, Tokyo Police Detective Kyoichiro Kaga went to collect the ashes of his recently
                            deceased mother. Years before, she ran away from her husband and son without explanation or
                            any further contact, only to die alone in an apartment far away, leaving her estranged son
                            with many unanswered questions.

                            Now in Tokyo, Michiko Oshitani is found dead many miles from home. Strangled to death, left
                            in the bare apartment rented under a false name by a man who has disappeared without a
                            trace. Oshitani lived far away in Sendai, with no known connection to Tokyo - and neither
                            her family nor friends have any idea why she would have gone there.

                            Hers is the second strangulation death in that approximate area of Tokyo - the other was a
                            homeless man, killed and his body burned in a tent by the river. As the police search
                            through Oshitani's past for any clue that might shed some light, one of the detectives
                            reaches out to Detective Kaga for advice. As the case unfolds, an unexpected connective
                            emerges between the murder (or murders) now and the long-ago case of Detective Kaga's
                            missing mother.

                            The Final Curtain, one of Keigo Higashino's most acclaimed mysteries, brings the story of
                            Detective Kaga to a surprising conclusion in a series of rich, surprising twists..</p>
